         Padding Considerations for DNS Zone Transfers-over-TLS
                        draft-ssahib-xot-padding

Abstract

   [I-D.draft-ietf-dprive-xfr-over-tls] specifies use of TLS to prevent
   zone content collection via passive monitoring of zone transfers.
   This document lists considerations for various padding policies and
   provides recommendations.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Padding for AXoT

   As mentioned in [I-D.draft-ietf-dprive-xfr-over-tls], the goal of
   padding AXoT responses would be two fold:

   *  to obfuscate the actual size of the transferred zone to minimize
      information leakage about the entire contents of the zone.

   *  to obfuscate the incremental changes to the zone between SOA
      updates to minimize information leakage about zone update activity
      and growth.
